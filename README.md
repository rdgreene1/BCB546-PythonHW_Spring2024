## Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter notebook in this repository contains all the code I used to analyze the data and finish Dr. X's script. The notebook is named 'Python_assignment.ipynb'.

## Dr. X's Script

I added all the final functions and code to Dr. X's script so that it can be ran to analyze the data. I'm not sure if I was supposed to do that, but it made sense to me to finish the script that way. The finished script is still named 'sequence_translate.py'. 

## Final Data File

I saved the final data file as 'penguins_mass_cytb.csv'.
